**goatstats**
This is a project to show that statistics taken out of context can show (almost) anybody as a great football player.
Have you ever wanted to claim your favourite average player was better than Messi only to be faced with the classic
rebuttal of Messi's stats? Fear no more, there will always be an array of niche stats that when displayed in an
attractive graph will prove once and for all that Harry Winks is indeed better than Toni Kroos.
